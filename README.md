# üé¨ HelloHood (React Frontend) ‚Äî [DISCONTINUED]

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is **discontinued** due to security and scalability considerations.  
> Admin and user-facing functionalities have been moved to separate applications to improve maintainability and performance.

## üìå Notice

This React frontend project previously handled both public and admin functionalities for managing and displaying movie/series data. As the project evolved, we decided to **split it into two separate apps**:

- A **public-facing web app** to browse and filter movies/series.
- A **secured admin panel** to manage content with authentication and role-based access.

The backend has also been refactored into:
- A **public API** (read-only endpoints).
- A **CRM/admin API** (protected write endpoints with authentication).
